# SeungGPT Model

SeungGPT is a language model, which uses machine learning techniques to produce human-like text. It is based on the transformer architecture, specifically the GPT model designed by OpenAI.

## Features

- Capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant sentences by predicting the next word in a sentence.
- Can perform tasks like translation, question-answering, and even creating a piece of writing.
- Trained on a diverse range of internet text, but can be fine-tuned on a specific text or task to generate more specific or targeted results.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You can then install SeungGPT using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seung7361/SeungGPTModel
```

# Usage

To use the model to generate text:
```
model = GPTModel()
input_prompt = "This is an eample sentence."
print(self.generate(input_prompt, max_length=256))
```
